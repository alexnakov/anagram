Next steps:

- Clean up your excitation/de-excitation functions
- Decide whether the canMoveUp, canMoveDown attributes are needed.
  I don't seem to use that thanks to the single fire of the onKeyUp inline
  event in the transparents, self-focusing input box.
- Handle caps lock to work

After that:

- work on making the input box really autofocused after every event
- Since the main single-player functionality of the app is almost finished,
  you can work on some design of the latter and the backgroundColor
